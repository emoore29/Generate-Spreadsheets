# Generate Spreadsheets

This is a small program I wrote to automate a tedious work task of updating a weekly availability spreadsheet for sending my weekly availability to the company I work for.  

It updates the date in B4 of the availability template, which then autopopulates the other dates in the spreadsheet. It prompts the user to decide on a "start date", whether that be next Monday or another upcoming Monday. Then it will autogenerate the number of spreadsheets requested, each starting on the following consecutive Monday.

I plan to set it up to automatically run every week, which is why there is a message printed when it opens to that effect.

I run it in Anaconda Prompt because I have Python installed with Anaconda. I'm still figuring out if that was a mistake or not.
